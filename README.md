## Lessons Learned

- I became proficient in reading and understanding the code.
- My code writing style became cleaner as i used ES6 and React to write code and used import export so that code become well structured.
- I learned about many new things in React and Chakra Ui that i didn't know before.
- My skills in React, JavaScript and DOM manipulation became better.
- I also learned how to plan a project and execute that in a limited time frame.
